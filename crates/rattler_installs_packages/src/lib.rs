//! RIP is a library that allows the resolving and installing of Python PyPI packages from Rust into a virtual environment.
//! It's based on our experience with building Rattler and aims to provide the same experience but for PyPI instead of Conda.
//! It should be fast and easy to use.
//! Like Rattler, this library is not a package manager itself but provides the low-level plumbing to be used in one.
