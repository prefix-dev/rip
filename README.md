`RIP` is a library that allows the resolving and installing of Python [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) packages from Rust into a virtual environment. 
It's based on our experience with building [Rattler](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler) and aims to provide the same
experience but for PyPi instead of Conda.
It should be fast and easy to use. Like Rattler, this library is not a package manager itself but provides the low-level plumbing to be used in one.

`RIP` is based on the quite excellent work of [posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and we have tried to credit
the authors where possible.

# Showcase

Let's resolve the `flask` python package.
We've added a small binary to showcase this:

![flask-install](https://github.com/prefix-dev/rip/assets/417374/75826d3e-717d-45fa-bc79-3bd0dec713d5)

This showcases the downloading and caching of metadata from PyPi. As well as the package resolution using our solver, more on this below.
We cache everything in a local directory, so that we can re-use the metadata and don't have to download it again.

## Features

This is a list of current and planned features of `RIP`, the biggest are listed below:

* [x] Downloading and aggressive caching of PyPi metadata.
* [x] Resolving of PyPi packages using [Resolvo](https://github.com/mamba-org/resolvo).
* [ ] Installation of wheel files (planned)
* [ ] Support sdist files (planned)

More intricacies of the PyPi ecosystem need to be implemented, see our GitHub issues for more details.


# Solver

We have integrated the stand-alone packaging SAT solver [Resolvo](https://github.com/mamba-org/resolvo), to resolve pypi packages.
This solver is incremental and adds packaging metadata during resolution of the SAT problem.
This feature can be enabled with the `resolvo-pypi` feature flag.
