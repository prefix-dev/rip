`RIP` is a library that allows the resolving and installing of Python [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) packages from Rust into a virtual environment.
It's based on our experience with building [Rattler](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler) and aims to provide the same
experience but for PyPI instead of Conda.
It should be fast and easy to use. Like Rattler, this library is not a package manager itself but provides the low-level plumbing to be used in one.

`RIP` is based on the quite excellent work of [posy](https://github.com/njsmith/posy) and we have tried to credit
the authors where possible.

# Showcase

Let's resolve the `flask` python package.
We've added a small binary in `rip_bin` to showcase this:

![flask-install](https://github.com/prefix-dev/rip/assets/4995967/5b0356b6-8e06-47bb-9424-94b3fdd9da09)

This showcases the downloading and caching of metadata from PyPI. As well as the package resolution using our solver, more on this below.
We cache everything in a local directory so that we can re-use the metadata and don't have to download it again.

# Installation

We have added very simple installation support for the resolved packages.
For testing purposes exclusively, we have added a `--install-into` flag to the `rip_bin` binary.
Use the `--install-into <some_path>` to create a venv and install the packages into it.
There is no detection of existing packages yet.

## Features

This is a list of current and planned features of `RIP`, the biggest are listed below:

* [x] Downloading and aggressive caching of PyPI metadata.
* [x] Resolving of PyPI packages using [Resolvo](https://github.com/mamba-org/resolvo).
* [x] Installation of wheel files (see: https://github.com/prefix-dev/rip/issues/6 for last open issues)
* [x] Support sdist files

More intricacies of the PyPI ecosystem need to be implemented, see our GitHub issues for more details.


# Solver

We have integrated the stand-alone packaging SAT solver [Resolvo](https://github.com/mamba-org/resolvo), to resolve pypi packages.
This solver is incremental and adds packaging metadata during resolution of the SAT problem.
This feature can be enabled with the `resolvo` feature flag.
