## [0.9.0] - 2024-04-22
### ðŸ“ƒ Details

#### Changed
- Expand ResolveOptions and adds ability pass WheelBuilder directly into resolve
- Use which to find the correct python executable
- Simplify `Wheel` API

#### Fixed

## [0.8.1] - 2024-02-15
### ðŸ“ƒ Details

#### Fixed
- Print packagedb error during wheel build
- Issue with zip and artifact:from_file
- Supress git clone output and long test names

## [0.8.0] - 2024-02-13
### âœ¨ Highlights

We've sped up the resolution code significantly, turns out the cache reading operations were quite slow due to the number of syscalls.
These have now been reduced and the bottleneck has been eliminated.

### ðŸ“ƒ Details

#### Added
- Increase performance by reducing number of syscalls in http cache (#216)
- Always writes a `direct_url.json` when a dependency is specified from source

#### Fixed
- Limits the amount of concurrent tasks with the new async resolvo code
- Correctly limits the concurrency, by limiting the `tokio::spawn`'s in all cases

## [0.7.0] - 2024-02-09
### âœ¨ Highlights

Lots of changes in this release, the two main ones:
- This release adds installing for source trees, git and local file references.
- This release uses `resolvo` 0.4.0, which includes getting dependencies asynchronously, sometimes with a 3x speedup.

### ðŸ“ƒ Details

#### Added
- Add support for installing file, http and git reference.
- Add support for stree in get_metadata, this was still missing.
- Add support for stree installing.

#### Changed
- Move `wheel_builder` module error type as it was growing large.
- Refactored some logic out of the `PackageDb`.
- Pep440 and pep508 updates.
- Introduced `HasArtifactName` trait, so STRee can be used more ergonomically.
- Find python distributions in arbitrary directory, instead of only venvs.
- Renamed `Artifact` and `SourceArtifact` traits, so that it is more clear what the use of each is.
- Access PKG-INFO and pyproject.toml directly, so that the library users can access this.
- Move types in `resolve` module to seperate files for clarity.

#### Fixed
- Use version and url in pinned package.
- Actually skip 404s.
- Only write out amount of bytes read for gzip.
- Fix an intra-doc link failure that passed through and caused CI failures.
- Fixes error that occured when a venv already had a symlinked python.

#### Removed
- Remove all lifetimes from PackageDb and WheelBuilder to simplify code.


## [0.6.0] - 2024-02-02

### ðŸ“ƒ Details

## [0.3.0] - 2024-01-16
### âœ¨ Highlights
